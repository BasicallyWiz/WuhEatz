# Wuh Eatz
Wuh Loves To Eatz!

## Components doko??
This project uses another project called WizWebComponents, which is a project I've made to create a re-useable set of Blazor web components.
Get it [here](https://github.com/BasicallyWiz/WizWebComponents)

```
ProjectsFolder/
    WizWebComponents/
      WizWebComponents.sln
      WizWebComponents.csproj
    WuhEatz/
      WuhEatz.sln
      WuhEatz/
        WuhEatz.csproj
```
By default, the project structure should look similar to this, with both projects having their root folder in the same location.

This can, however be easily changed by setting a new path in the WuhEatz project file.

## I'd Like to contribute, but I don't know where to start...
If you're using Visual Studio, open the Tasks view, and try wokring on some tasks.

The Tasks view searches the entire solution for comments that start with `//TODO`, which are tasks that need to be completed.
That's a good place to start. Then, when you're more comfortable, you can work on issues, or add features you'd like to see implemented.

## If you do contribute, no matter how small, add your name to the credits.razor page!
