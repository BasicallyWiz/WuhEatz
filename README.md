Wuh Loves To Eatz!

## Components doko??
This project uses another project called WizWebComponents, which is a project I've made to create a re-useable set of Blazor web components.
Get it [here](https://github.com/BasicallyWiz/WizWebComponents)

```
ProjectsFolder/
    WizWebComponents/
      WizWebComponents.sln
      WizWebComponents.csproj
    WuhEatz/
      WuhEatz.sln
      WuhEatz/
        WuhEatz.csproj
```
By default, the project structure should look similar to this, with both projects having their root folder in the same location.

This can, however be easily changed by setting a new path in the WuhEatz project file.
